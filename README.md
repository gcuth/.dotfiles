# Galen's .dotfiles

My extremely chaotic, vim-centric, computational-social-science-in-the-cloud-ish dotfiles. Made painless and idempotent with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). Scripts lean heavily on [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka).

## Installation

```shell
cd .dotfiles
./install
```

Now get back to work.
