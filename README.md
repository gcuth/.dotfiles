# Galen's .dotfiles

My extremely chaotic, terminal-centric, computational-social-science-in-the-cloud-ish dotfiles. Made painless and idempotent with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). Built with a fresh Ubuntu install and itchy fingertips in mind.

## Installation

```shell
cd .dotfiles
./install
```
