# Galen's .dotfiles

My extremely chaotic computational-social-science-in-the-cloud-ish dotfiles. Made painless and idempotent with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). Scripts lean heavily on [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka).

## Installation

```shell
cd .dotfiles
./install
```

On a completely fresh `macOS` install, you would *probably* try the following:

0. [ ] `git clone https://github.com/gcuth/.dotfiles.git`
1. [ ] `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
2. [ ] `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
3. [ ] `./install`
4. [ ] `./macos/setup`


Now get back to work.
