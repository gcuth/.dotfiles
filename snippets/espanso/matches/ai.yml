    replace: "I'd like your help working on some outstanding tasks. Before we begin collaborating, please familiarise yourself with the codebase in its current form. Be thorough. Start by reading `CLAUDE.md` carefully, but make sure to verify and cross-check your understanding by examining the codebase directly. Once you're confident that you have a firm grasp on the present implementation, read `TODO.md`. Identify the first incomplete task and begin work on it. Remember to be rigorous and systematic at all stages of development. Ensure that your code aligns with established best practices. Prioritise clarity and maintainability. Always follow a strict a TDD methodology (refer to workflow guide at the end of `TODO.md`). Stop and report back to me once you've completed a task."
