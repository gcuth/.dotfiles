# espanso match file
#
# This file is used to define 'pretty' snippets: words where I want to replace
# the trigger word with one containing special non-ascii characters for
# 'correctness' and/or persnicketyness (eg 'naive'-> 'naïve').
#
# (It's an ad-hoc list, and it needs expansion (pun intended).)

matches:
  - trigger: "naive"
    replace: "naïve"
  - trigger: "facade"
    replace: "façade"
